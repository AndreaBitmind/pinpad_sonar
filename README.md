# Pin Pad Sonar

Welcome to the Pin Pad Sonar project, an interactive PIN entry application. This project showcases a PIN pad interface that allows users to input a PIN combination and receive feedback on its accuracy. The correct combination to unlock is 8, 5, 3, and 0. After three unsuccessful attempts, the Pin Pad locks for 30 seconds as a security measure.
